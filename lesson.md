### Lesson Overview

IT infrastructure has become a critical component of today’s business world. As more organizations rely on computing power, storage, and applications, being without these mission-essential assets is an almost unfathomable thought, underpinning the importance of investing in disaster recovery. This glossary explores what disaster recovery is, why it matters, and what goes into developing an effective Disaster Recovery Plan.

A Disaster Recovery, Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP), Disaster Recovery Implementation Plan, or IT Disaster Recovery is a policy and/or process that is designed to assist an organization in executing recovery processes in response to a disaster to protect business IT infrastructure and more generally promote recovery. Disasters take many shapes and forms and can include cyber-attacks, natural disasters, theft or sabotage, power failures, IT network failures, events affecting an organization’s reputation, and also outbreaks of diseases or infections that impact operations.

The **purpose** of a **disaster recovery** is to comprehensively explain the consistent actions that must be taken before, during, and after the disaster so that the entire team can take those actions. A disaster recovery should address and contains detailed instructions on how to respond to unplanned incidents such as natural disasters, power outages, cyber attacks and any other disruptive events. The plan contains strategies on minimizing the effects of a disaster, so an organization will continue to operate – or quickly resume key operations.


**Why Company or Organization Invest in DR**

Disaster recovery offers organizations a means of salvaging their operational capacity and can save them from devastating losses that could lead to a complete shutdown. By investing in disaster recovery, organizations can build more resilience and a stronger competitive advantage. 

Here are some reasons to why company or organization need to have disaster recovery plan:  

- **Prevent Revenue Loss:** As more businesses rely on technology to operate, IT infrastructure holds tremendous value. Without an operational IT infrastructure, businesses can suffer significant revenue losses.
- **Enhance resilience:** Committing to disaster recovery can be costly, however, it improves an organization’s ability to quickly return to business as usual after a disaster. Through regular DR testing, organizations developed the resiliency they need to limit the effects of disasters on their operations.
- **To Maintain Customer Satisfaction:** DR plans tested develop resilience that pays dividends over time. It’s a well-known fact that customer acquisition costs exceed customer retention costs. By being prepared for disasters, customer attrition is limited if not averted altogether.
- **Improve partner and supply chain confidence:** Due to the connectedness of organizations and their reliance on partner resources and infrastructure, investing in DR can improve relationships and confidence. Short recovery time objectives or RTOs and recovery point objectives or RPOs, as a result of DR planning and investment, are viewed as a commitment to meeting service level agreements, making a stronger case for long-lasting relationships. 
- **Hardware failure is possible:** IT hardware is machinery and, therefore, prone to breakdown and failure. Having a DR plan accounts for outages and prevents unnecessary downtime.
- **Compliance:** As security and privacy grow in importance, new regulations are introduced to protect sensitive information. Investing in a DR plan ensures that you stay ahead of compliance requirements.
